# A Lover's Discourse
- "Adorable!"
    - and this everything he *bestows upon* the other in the form of a blank word, for the Whole cannot be inventoried without being diminished: in *Adorable*! there is no residual quality, but only the everthing of affect.
    - the choice, so *rigorous* that it *retains* only the Unique
    - Herein a great enigma, **to** which I shall never posses the key
    - What perhaps incredibly tenuous portion -- what accident? The way a nail is cut, a tooth broken slightly aslant, a lock of hair, a way of spreading the fingers while talking, while smoking? About all these *folds* of the body...
    - Yet the more I experience the specialty of my desire, the less I can give it a name; to the precision of the target corresponds a wavering of the name; what is characteristic of descire, proper to desire, can produce only *an impropriety of the utterance*
    - Adorable is **the futile vestige of a fatigue**, the fatigue of language itself
    - I intoxicate myself upon its affirmation: is not tautology that preposterous state in which are to be found, all values being confounded, the glorious end of the logical operation, the *obscenity* of stupidity, and the explosion of *Nietzschean* yes?
